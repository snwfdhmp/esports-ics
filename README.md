# Liquipedia to iCal

[![Liquipedia to iCal](https://i.imgur.com/GgW2kgA.png)](https://ics.snwfdhmp.com)

- Sync Liquipedia matches to your Calendar.
- Events are refreshed when the iCal URL is re-fetched by your Calendar. (generally every 15 minutes)

## What is it ?

I was tired of not having any simple way of adding esport matches to my calendar. Some apps tried to achieve that but none really achieved that simply and none integrates well into my workflow. So I build this.

This service lets you use **Liquipedia match pages as iCal URLs**, also known as .ICS URLs.

It parses the Liquipedia match page in real time and returns events as ICS.

## How does it work ?

Find the match page of the game you want. For example [Rocket League](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Liquipedia:Matches) or [League of Legends](https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/Liquipedia:Matches). <ins>Strictly use pages of this format or it won't work.</ins>

Copy the page URL and put it in this URL: `https://ics.snwfdhmp.com/matches.ics?url=YOUR_URL`.

Example URLs below on this page.

Import this URL in your Calendar App and it will produce events like this.

Events will be updated regularly with new matches. Every time the Calendar URL is fetched, it parses the Liquipedia page for new matches.

## How to filter only matches I'm interested in ?

Use URL parameters :

| Parameter name      | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `competition_regex` | Filter competition using REGEX.                                                                                    |
| `teams_regex`       | Filter teams using REGEX. Use team tags (eg: KC, T1)                                                               |
| `condition_is_or`   | Set to "true" if you want competition_regex and teams_regex to be tested as an OR condition (by default, its AND). |
| `ignore_tbd`        | Ignore matches that have "TBD" as team1 and team2 (TBD = To Be Done) (ie: announced match with unannounced teams)  |

Encode REGEX using [URL encoding](https://www.urlencoder.org/).
